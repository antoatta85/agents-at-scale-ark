# Ark Broker - Todo

## Tasks

- [x] Define objectives
- [ ] Build architecture → `ark-architect` agent
- [ ] Build  verifyable prototype

## Findings

Along the way, if we discover issues or have ideas that are not core to the feature or should be addressed separately, we track them in `99-findings/`. Some findings may be partially implemented during prototyping to enable verification, but typically they will be addressed in separate work items.
