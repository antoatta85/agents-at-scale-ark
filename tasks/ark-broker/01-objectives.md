# Ark Broker - Objectives

## Goal

Enable asynchronous communication between agents and users during query execution.

## Use Cases

- Agent asks user for clarification before proceeding
- Agent requests approval for destructive actions
- User sends follow-up questions to running agents
- User provides additional context mid-execution

## Success Criteria

- Questions can be created, retrieved, and answered through REST/Dashboard
- Queries can pause and resume based on pending questions
- Full visibility into query execution (tools, state, questions)
