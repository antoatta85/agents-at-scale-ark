To enable Langfuse tracing in your ARK deployments:

```yaml
containers:
- name: my-service
  envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: otel-environment-variables
      optional: true
```

After installation, restart deployments to apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ark-controller -n ark-system
```
