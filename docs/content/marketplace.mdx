# Agents at Scale Marketplace

Welcome to the Agents at Scale Marketplace - a curated collection of services, agents, and tools for the ARK platform.

## What is the Marketplace?

The marketplace is a centralized repository of:

- **Services**: Production-ready observability, storage, and infrastructure services
- **Agents**: Pre-built agents and agent templates
- **Tools**: Reusable tools and utilities for agent development
- **Projects**: Complete solution accelerators and reference implementations

## Available Services

Currently available services:

- **[Langfuse](../marketplace/docs/content/services/langfuse)** - Open Source LLM Application/Agent observability, evaluation, and prompt management
- **[Phoenix](../marketplace/docs/content/services/phoenix)** - AI/ML observability and evaluation platform with OpenTelemetry integration

## Quick Start

### Deploy a Service

```bash
# Deploy using Helm from local chart
cd marketplace/services/phoenix
helm dependency update chart/
helm install phoenix ./chart -n phoenix --create-namespace
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Use DevSpace for local development
cd marketplace/services/phoenix
devspace dev
```

## Marketplace Location

The marketplace is located at the root of the repository in the [`marketplace/`](../../marketplace/) directory. It includes:

- Helm charts for deploying services
- DevSpace configurations for local development
- Service documentation
- README files with usage instructions

## Contributing

When adding new services to the marketplace:

1. Create service directory: `marketplace/services/<service-name>/`
2. Add Helm chart: `marketplace/services/<service-name>/chart/`
3. Add DevSpace config: `marketplace/services/<service-name>/devspace.yaml`
4. Add documentation: `marketplace/docs/content/services/<service-name>.mdx`
5. Update the services index

For more details, see the [Marketplace README](../../marketplace/README.md).

## Future Plans

This marketplace is being prepared for migration to a dedicated repository where it will include:
- Additional observability services
- Pre-built agents and agent templates
- Reusable tools and utilities
- Complete projects and solution accelerators
