# Ark - Agentic Runtime for Kubernetes

ARK is a Kubernetes-based platform that provides a runtime and enables management and orchestration of AI agents and their resources. It provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) and services to handle:

- AI model configurations
- Autonomous agents
- Multi-agent teams
- Tool integrations
- Memory persistence
- Performance evaluation

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Agents at Scale - Agentic platform and runtime for Kubernetes ("Ark") Technical Preview should **not** be run without reading the [Disclaimer](./disclaimer.mdx), which covers key risk topics.
>
> We are transitioning this project to our open-source repository. During this process we will be moving documentation URLs, artifact registries, etc. Some builds, artifacts and pipelines may be impacted.

Build, deploy and operate agentic solutions using proven patterns and practices that are reliable for complex distributed systems.
