# ARK - Agentic Runtime for Kubernetes

ARK is a Kubernetes-based platform that provides a runtime and enables management and orchestration of AI agents and their resources. It provides [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and services to handle:

- [AI model configurations](./user-guide/models).
- [Autonomous agents](./user-guide/agents).
- [Multi-agent teams](./user-guide/teams).
- [Tool integrations](./user-guide/tools).
- [Memory persistence](./reference/resources/memory).
- [Performance evaluation](./reference/evaluations/evaluations).

This documentation explains how to build, deploy, and operate agentic solutions using proven patterns and practices that are reliable for complex distributed systems.

Find out more about the [core concepts of ARK](./core-concepts).

## Get started
Follow the [Quickstart](./quickstart.mdx) guide to install ARK locally.
