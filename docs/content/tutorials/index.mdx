# Tutorials

Welcome to ARK Tutorials! These hands-on guides will teach you practical skills through step-by-step exercises.

## What Are Tutorials?

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** guides that teach you skills through practice. They're different from how-to guides:

- **Tutorials**: "Learn to build X" (teaching skills)
- **How-to Guides**: "How do I do X?" (solving problems)

Think of tutorials as a cooking class where you learn techniques, while how-to guides are recipes when you already know what you want to make.
