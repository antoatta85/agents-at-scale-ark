# Your First Agent

In this tutorial, you'll create your first AI agent in ARK. By the end, you'll have a working agent that can answer questions and perform tasks.

**Time**: ~10 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: ARK installed, a Kubernetes cluster, and a configured model

## What You'll Build

A simple but capable agent that can:
- Answer questions conversationally
- Explain concepts clearly
- Perform calculations
- Remember context during a conversation

## Step 1: Verify Your Setup

First, ensure ARK is running and you have a model configured:

```bash
# Check ARK status
ark status

# List available models
ark models list

# If no models exist, create one
ark models create default
```

## Step 2: Create a Secret (If Needed)

If your model requires an API key, create a Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic default-model-secret \
  --from-literal=api-key='YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Step 3: Define Your Agent

Create a file named `my-first-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: first-agent
  namespace: default
spec:
  prompt: |
    You are a friendly and helpful assistant. You explain concepts clearly,
    answer questions thoroughly, and maintain a conversational tone.
    Always be concise but complete in your responses.
  modelRef:
    name: default
```

Key components:
- **name**: Unique identifier for your agent
- **prompt**: Instructions that define the agent's behavior
- **modelRef**: Which model to use (references a Model resource)

## Step 4: Deploy Your Agent

Apply the configuration to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-first-agent.yaml
```

Verify the agent was created:

```bash
kubectl get agents
kubectl describe agent first-agent
```

You should see the agent in a ready state.

## Step 5: Query Your Agent

Use the ARK CLI to interact with your agent:

```bash
# Simple query
ark query agent/first-agent "What is machine learning?"

# Follow-up question (agent remembers context)
ark query agent/first-agent "Can you explain that more simply?"
```

Or use kubectl to create a Query resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Query
metadata:
  name: my-first-query
spec:
  input: "Explain how neural networks work in simple terms"
  targets:
    - type: agent
      name: first-agent
```

Apply and check the result:

```bash
kubectl apply -f query.yaml
kubectl get query my-first-query
kubectl get query my-first-query -o yaml  # See full response
```

## Step 6: Improve Your Agent

Let's enhance the agent with a better prompt:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: first-agent
spec:
  prompt: |
    You are an expert educator with a gift for making complex topics
    accessible. Your goal is to help people learn by:
    
    1. Breaking down complex concepts into digestible parts
    2. Using analogies and examples
    3. Checking for understanding
    4. Adapting your explanation to the user's level
    
    Be friendly, patient, and encouraging. If something is unclear,
    ask clarifying questions.
  modelRef:
    name: default
```

Update the agent:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-first-agent.yaml
```

## Understanding What Happened

When you created the agent, ARK:

1. **Validated** the configuration
2. **Registered** it as a Kubernetes resource
3. **Made it available** for queries
4. **Tracked its status** and health

When you queried the agent:

1. ARK **received** your query
2. **Retrieved** the agent configuration
3. **Loaded** the model and prompt
4. **Executed** the LLM reasoning
5. **Returned** the response
6. **Stored** the result in the Query resource

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created your first agent. Now explore:

- **Add Tools**: [Creating Tools and MCP Servers](/user-guide/tools) - Give your agent capabilities
- **Build Teams**: [Build a Multi-Agent Team](./multi-agent-team) - Coordinate multiple agents
- **Use Memory**: [Memory and State](/explanations/concepts/memory-and-state) - Persistent conversations
- **Monitor Performance**: Check agent metrics and logs in the dashboard

## Common Issues

**Agent not found**: Verify the agent was created with `kubectl get agents`

**Model errors**: Ensure your model is configured and available with `ark models list`

**No response**: Check the Query resource status with `kubectl describe query <name>`
