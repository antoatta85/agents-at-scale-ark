# A2A Gateway

> **Note:** The A2A Gateway functionality has been integrated into the main ARK API service. This page is kept for reference. For installation and usage, see [ARK API](/developer-guide/services/ark-api).

Ark's Agent-to-Agent Gateway exposes Ark agents via the [A2A Protocol](https://github.com/a2a-integration/a2a-spec) for standardized agent-to-agent communication.

The A2A Gateway is now part of the **ARK API** service. When you install `ark-api`, the A2A Gateway endpoints are automatically available.

## API Endpoints

The following A2A endpoints are available as part of ARK API:

- **`GET /agents`** - List all available Ark agents
- **`GET /agent/{agent-name}/.well-known/agent.json`** - Get agent card
- **`GET /agent/{agent-name}/*`** - Dynamic A2A protocol routes for each agent

## Configuration

Environment variables (configured in ARK API):
- **`ARK_A2A_LISTEN_PORT`** (default: uses `PORT` env var, typically `8000`) - Port for agent card URLs
- **`ARK_A2A_LISTEN_HOST`** (default: `localhost`) - Host for agent card URLs
- **`ARK_A2A_LISTEN_PROTOCOL`** (default: `http`) - Protocol scheme
- **`ARK_A2A_LISTEN_PATH`** (optional) - Path prefix for agent card URLs

## Migration

If you were previously using the separate `ark-api-a2a` service, you can now use the same endpoints through the main `ark-api` service. The endpoints remain at the same paths (`/agents`, `/agent/*`), but are now served by `ark-api` instead of a separate service.
