Note: these skills are largely designed for agents running in sandboxes, with access to `kind` to run clusters.

## Quickstart

Open Claude, choose `/Plugin` to interactively add the marketplace `mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark`, or:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark
claude plugin install ark@agents-at-scale-ark
```

For local development or fork:

```bash
# Change the path on 'add' to your path.
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install ark@agents-at-scale-ark
```

## Plugin: ark

**Examples**

> Use the 'ark researcher' agent to discover how the MCP Asynchronous Task protocol works, this was only released in November 2025 so you will have to do a lot of exploration

> Use the 'ark security patcher' agent to fix security vulnerabilities: "Fix CVE-2025-55183 in Ark" or "The current version of golang has a vulnerability, fix it in ark"
