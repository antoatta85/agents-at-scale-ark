# End-to-End Testing

Ark uses [Chainsaw](https://github.com/kyverno/chainsaw) to declaratively create resources, run scripts, and validate resources. For example, we can create agents, teams, and queries and validate the statuses of each and the success state of a query or evaluation.

## Setup

### Install Chainsaw CLI

Install chainsaw for running tests locally:

```bash
# Install with Go
go install github.com/kyverno/chainsaw@latest

# Install with Homebrew
brew tap kyverno/chainsaw https://github.com/kyverno/chainsaw
brew install kyverno/chainsaw/chainsaw
```

## Running Tests Locally

### Simulate GitHub E2E Environment

To replicate the GitHub workflow environment locally:

```bash
# Optionally install k3d and create test cluster. If you are already running a
# cluster locally there is no need to run this step.
brew install k3d
k3d cluster create ark-e2e

# Set LLM config if you want to run tests that call models.
export E2E_TEST_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=yourkey
export E2E_TEST_AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=yoururl

# Run standard tests. Choose a specific path rather than '.' to run only a
# specific scenario.
chainsaw test --config .chainsaw.yaml --selector '!evaluated' .
```
