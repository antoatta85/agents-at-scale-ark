# Handle Team Failures

This guide explains how to handle failures in team execution.

## Failure Types

### Agent Failures

Individual agent failures:
- Agent errors
- Model connection issues
- Tool execution failures

### Team Coordination Failures

Team-level failures:
- Communication errors
- Strategy execution issues
- Timeout failures

## Failure Handling

### Retry Logic

Configure retries for transient failures:
- Automatic retries
- Exponential backoff
- Maximum retry attempts

### Error Recovery

Handle errors gracefully:
- Fallback strategies
- Error propagation
- Partial success handling

### Timeout Configuration

Set appropriate timeouts:
- Per-agent timeouts
- Team-level timeouts
- Query timeouts

## Monitoring

Monitor team execution:
- Track failure rates
- Identify failure patterns
- Review error logs
- Analyze failure causes

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate timeouts
- Configure retry logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Monitor and alert on failures
