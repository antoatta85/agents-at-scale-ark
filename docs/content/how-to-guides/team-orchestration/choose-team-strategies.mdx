# Choose Team Strategies

This guide helps you choose the right team strategy for your use case.

## Strategy Comparison

### Sequential

**Best for:**
- Linear workflows
- Dependent steps
- Clear execution order

**Example:** Research → Analysis → Creation

### Round-Robin

**Best for:**
- Load balancing
- Independent requests
- Equal participation

**Example:** Customer support rotation

### Graph-Based

**Best for:**
- Complex workflows
- Conditional routing
- Dynamic decisions

**Example:** Multi-path analysis

### Selector

**Best for:**
- Dynamic selection
- Specialized routing
- Context-dependent choice

**Example:** Expert selection

## Decision Framework

1. **Workflow Type**: Linear or branching?
2. **Dependencies**: Do steps depend on each other?
3. **Parallelism**: Can steps run simultaneously?
4. **Decision Making**: Is routing dynamic?

## Best Practices

- Start with sequential for simplicity
- Use round-robin for load balancing
- Use graph for complex workflows
- Use selector for dynamic routing
