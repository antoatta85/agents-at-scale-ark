# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is ARK?

ARK (Agentic Runtime for Kubernetes) is a Kubernetes-native platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents at scale. It provides custom resources, APIs, and tooling to manage agents as first-class Kubernetes citizens.

### What are流失 agents?

Agents are autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and act to accomplish goals. In ARK, agents combine large language models with prompts, tools, and memory to perform tasks.

### Do I need Kubernetes to use ARK?

Yes, ARK requires a Kubernetes cluster. It can be local (Minikube, Kind, Docker Desktop) or cloud-based (EKS, GKE, AKS).

### Is ARK production-ready?

ARK is in **technical preview**. While it includes production patterns, it's rapidly evolving. See the [Disclaimer](/disclaimer) for important information about using ARK.

## Getting Started

### How do I install ARK?

See the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide. Basic installation:

```bash
npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark
ark install
```

### What prerequisites do I need?

- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)
- kubectl configured
- Helm installed
- Node.js (for CLI)

### How do I configure a model?

```bash
ark models create default
```

Or create a Model resource manually. See [Creating and Managing Models](/user-guide/models).

## Agents

### What's the difference between an agent and a team?

- **Agent**: Single AI system handling a task
- **Team**: Multiple agents working together with coordination

See [Agents vs Teams](/explanations/concepts/agents-vs-teams) for details.

### How do I update an agent's prompt?

Update the agent YAML and apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f agent.yaml
```

ARK will update the agent without downtime.

### Can agents remember previous conversations?

Yes, using Memory resources. See [Memory and State](/explanations/concepts/memory-and-state).

### How do I debug an agent that's not working?

1. Check agent status: `kubectl describe agent <name>`
2. View query results: `kubectl get queries`
3. Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app=ark-controller`
4. See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) for common issues

## Teams

### When should I use a team instead of an agent?

Use teams when you need:
- Multiple specialized agents
- Coordination between steps
- Quality assurance/review
- Parallel processing

See [Agents vs Teams](/explanations/concepts/agents-vs-teams) for decision guidance.

### What team strategies are available?

- **Sequential**: Agents work one after another
- **Round-Robin**: Agents take turns
- **Graph**: Complex workflows with dependencies
- **Selector**: AI-powered agent selection

See [Team Strategies](/user-guide/samples/teams/team-strategies).

## Tools and MCP

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for agents to access external tools and capabilities. ARK uses MCP servers to provide tools to agents.

### How do I add custom tools?

1. Create or deploy an MCP server
2. Register it as an MCPServer resource
3. Reference tools in your agent configuration

See [Creating Tools and MCP Servers](/user-guide/tools).

### Can I use my own MCP server?

Yes! ARK supports any MCP-compliant server. See [MCP Integration](/explanations/mcp-integration).

## Deployment and Operations

### How do I deploy ARK to production?

See [Deploying ARK](/operations-guide/deploying-ark) for production deployment guide.

### How do I monitor agents?

- Dashboard: `ark dashboard`
- kubectl: `kubectl get agents,queries`
- Events: `kubectl get events`
- Observability: See [Observability](/developer-guide/observability)

### How do I scale agents?

ARK agents are Kubernetes resources. Use standard K8s scaling:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- ReplicaSets for multiple instances
- Resource quotas for limits

### How do I backup agent configurations?

Agent configurations are Kubernetes resources. Backup with:
```bash
kubectl get agents -o yaml > agents-backup.yaml
```

Or use GitOps to version control configurations.

## Development

### How do I contribute to ARK?

See [Contributing](./contributing) guide. ARK welcomes contributions!

### Can I extend ARK?

Yes! ARK is designed for extensibility:
- Custom execution engines
- Custom tools via MCP
- Custom resources (advanced)

See [Developer Guide](/developer-guide).

### How do I set up local development?

See [Local Development](/developer-guide/local-development).

## Cost and Performance

### How much do agents cost to run?

Cost depends on:
- Model provider (OpenAI, Azure, etc.)
- Number of queries
- Token usage per query
- Team complexity (multiple agents = multiple LLM calls)

Monitor costs via your model provider dashboard.

### How do I optimize agent performance?

- Use appropriate models (smaller for simple tasks)
- Optimize prompts (smaller prompts = fewer tokens)
- Cache responses when possible
- Use teams efficiently (avoid unnecessary agents)
- Monitor token usage per query

### Can I limit agent resource usage?

Yes, via Kubernetes resource limits:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

## Comparison with Alternatives

### How is ARK different from LangChain?

- **ARK**: Kubernetes-native, production-focused, multi-agent
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM apps, more flexible, less opinionated

See [Kubernetes-Native Design](/explanations/architecture/kubernetes-native-design) for benefits.

### Should I use ARK or AutoGen?

- **ARK**: Production deployment, Kubernetes integration, enterprise features
- **AutoGen**: Research, prototyping, simpler setup

Choose ARK for production; AutoGen for rapid prototyping.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent queries are failing

1. Check model availability: `ark models list`
2. Verify agent status: `kubectl describe agent <name>`
3. Check query status: `kubectl describe query <name>`
4. Review logs: `kubectl logs -l app=ark-controller`

### Cannot connect to Kubernetes

1. Verify kubeconfig: `kubectl cluster-info`
2. Check namespace: `kubectl get ns`
3. Verify ARK installation: `ark status`

### Models not working

1. Check API keys in secrets: `kubectl get secrets`
2. Verify model configuration: `kubectl describe model <name>`
3. Test model directly: `ark models query default "test"`
