## Usage Questions

### How do I create an agent?

Define an Agent resource using the Agent CRD. See the [Agent Guide](../how-to-guides/agent-development/create-and-configure-agents) for details.

### How do agents communicate?

Agents communicate using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. See [Communication Patterns](../explanations/team-patterns/communication-patterns-a2a) for details.

### How do I add tools to agents?

## Technical Questions

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides orchestration, scaling, and resource management essential for production agentic systems.

### How does evaluation work?

Ark supports event-based evaluation. See [Evaluation Philosophy](../explanations/evaluation-philosophy/why-evaluate-agents) for details.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol - a standardized protocol for connecting agents to external tools. See [What is MCP](../explanations/mcp-integration/what-is-mcp) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents not responding?

Check agent status: `kubectl get agents`
Verify model is ready: `kubectl get models`
Check controller logs: `kubectl logs -n ark-system deployment/ark-controller-manager`

### Queries not completing?

Check query status: `kubectl describe query <query-name>`
Verify agent/team status: `kubectl get agents,teams`
View events: `kubectl get events`
