# Authorization and RBAC

Authorization determines what authenticated users can do in Ark.

## Authorization Overview

Authorization answers:
- What resources can users access?
- What actions can they perform?
- What data can they see?

## RBAC Model

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides:
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions
- **Users**: Individuals or services
- **Bindings**: Connect users to roles

## Ark RBAC

Ark uses Kubernetes RBAC:
- Standard Kubernetes roles
- Custom Ark roles
- Namespace-scoped permissions
- Cluster-scoped permissions

## Common Roles

### End User

Can:
- Create queries
- View own resources
- Execute agents

Cannot:
- Modify agents
- Access other users' resources
- Administer system

### Agent Builder

Can:
- Create and modify agents
- Create teams
- Configure tools

Cannot:
- Modify system configuration
- Access other tenants
- Deploy infrastructure

### Platform Engineer

Can:
- Deploy Ark
- Configure infrastructure
- Manage system resources

Cannot:
- Access user data
- Modify user resources
- Bypass security

## Namespace Isolation

Resources are isolated by namespace:
- Each tenant has a namespace
- Resources cannot cross namespaces
- Access is namespace-scoped

## Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum required permissions
- **Regular Audits**: Review permissions periodically
- **Separate Environments**: Different permissions for dev/prod
- **Monitor Access**: Track authorization decisions
- **Document Policies**: Clear access policies
