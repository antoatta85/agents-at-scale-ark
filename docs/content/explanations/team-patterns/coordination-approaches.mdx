# Coordination Approaches

Different coordination approaches suit different use cases and team structures.

## Centralized Coordination

A central coordinator manages team execution:
- Single point of control
- Centralized decision-making
- Clear execution flow
- Easier to debug

**Use when:** Simple workflows, clear structure

## Decentralized Coordination

Agents coordinate directly with each other:
- Distributed control
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Flexible execution
- More complex

**Use when:** Complex workflows, dynamic routing

## Hybrid Coordination

Combines centralized and decentralized:
- Coordinator for high-level flow
- Agents coordinate for details
- Balance of control and flexibility

**Use when:** Complex workflows with some structure

## Coordination Patterns

### Request-Response

Agents request help and receive responses:
- Clear communication
- Synchronous interaction
- Easy to understand

### Publish-Subscribe

Agents publish events, others subscribe:
- Asynchronous communication
- Loose coupling
- Event-driven

### Workflow Orchestration

Orchestrator manages workflow:
- Centralized control
- Clear execution order
- Easy to modify

## Best Practices

- Choose approach based on complexity
- Start with centralized for simplicity
- Use decentralized for flexibility
- Monitor coordination overhead
