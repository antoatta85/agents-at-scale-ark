# Team Strategies Explained

Team strategies determine how multiple agents coordinate and communicate when working together.

## Sequential Strategy

Agents execute one after another in a fixed order.

**Use when:**
- Workflows have clear stages
- Each step depends on the previous
- Linear processing is required

**Example:** Research → Analysis → Creation

## Round-Robin Strategy

Agents take turns handling requests in rotation.

**Use when:**
- Load balancing is needed
- Equal participation is desired
- Requests are independent

**Example:** Customer support agents sharing workload

## Graph-Based Strategy

Agents are organized in a graph with conditional routing.

**Use when:**
- Complex decision-making is needed
- Conditional workflows
- Dynamic routing required

**Example:** Multi-path analysis with branching logic

## Selector Strategy

A selector agent chooses which agent to use for each request.

**Use when:**
- Dynamic agent selection
- Context-dependent routing
- Specialized agent selection

**Example:** Routing requests to specialized experts

## Choosing a Strategy

Consider:
- **Workflow Structure**: Linear or branching?
- **Dependencies**: Do steps depend on each other?
- **Parallelism**: Can steps run simultaneously?
- **Decision Making**: Is routing dynamic?

## Best Practices

- Start simple with sequential
- Use round-robin for load balancing
- Use graph for complex workflows
- Use selector for dynamic routing
