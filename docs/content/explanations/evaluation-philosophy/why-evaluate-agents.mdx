# Why Evaluate Agents?

Evaluation is essential for building reliable, trustworthy agentic systems that work correctly in production.

## The Challenge

Agentic systems are:
- **Probabilistic**: Outputs vary between runs
- **Non-Deterministic**: Same input may produce different outputs
- **Complex**: Many interacting components
- **Autonomous**: Make decisions independently

This makes traditional testing insufficient.

## Why Evaluation Matters

### Trust and Reliability

Evaluation helps ensure:
- Agents behave as expected
- Outputs meet quality standards
- Systems work correctly
- Failures are detected early

### Continuous Improvement

Evaluation enables:
- Measuring performance over time
- Identifying regressions
- Comparing approaches
- Optimizing configurations

### Risk Management

Evaluation reduces risk by:
- Catching errors before production
- Validating critical behaviors
- Monitoring for drift
- Ensuring compliance

## Types of Evaluation

### Functional Evaluation

Does the agent do what it should?
- Correctness
- Completeness
- Accuracy

### Quality Evaluation

How well does the agent perform?
- Response quality
- Relevance
- Coherence

### Safety Evaluation

Is the agent safe to use?
- Harmful content detection
- Bias identification
- Security validation

### Performance Evaluation

How efficiently does the agent work?
- Response time
- Token usage
- Cost analysis

## Evaluation Approaches

### Automated Evaluation

Systematic, repeatable tests:
- Unit tests for agents
- Integration tests for teams
- End-to-end tests for workflows

### Human Evaluation

Human judgment for quality:
- Subjective assessment
- Complex scenarios
- Edge cases

### Hybrid Evaluation

Combine automated and human:
- Automated for coverage
- Human for quality
- Best of both approaches
