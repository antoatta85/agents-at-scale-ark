# Why MCP in Ark?

Ark uses MCP to provide a standardized, extensible way for agents to access external tools and capabilities.

## Design Alignment

MCP aligns with Ark's design principles:

### Open Standards

MCP is an open protocol, supporting Ark's commitment to open source technologies.

### Extensibility

MCP enables easy extension of agent capabilities without modifying core Ark code.

### Decoupling

MCP decouples tools from agents, allowing independent development and deployment.

### Standardization

MCP provides a consistent interface for all tools, regardless of implementation.

## Architecture Benefits

### Tool Isolation

Tools run in separate MCP servers:
- Isolated failures
- Independent scaling
- Security boundaries
- Resource management

### Tool Discovery

Agents automatically discover available tools:
- No manual configuration
- Dynamic tool availability
- Version management
- Capability negotiation

### Multi-Tenancy

MCP supports multi-tenant tool access:
- Shared tool servers
- Per-tenant isolation
- Access control
- Resource limits

## Integration Points

### MCPServer Resource

Kubernetes-native resource for MCP servers:
- Declarative configuration
- Lifecycle management
- Status tracking
- Health monitoring

### Tool References

Agents reference MCP tools:
- Simple tool selection
- Automatic discovery
- Type safety
- Validation

### ark-mcp Service

Ark's MCP integration service:
- Protocol handling
- Connection management
- Tool routing
- Error handling

## Use Cases

### External Integrations

Connect to external services:
- APIs
- Databases
- File systems
- Cloud services

### Custom Tools

Build custom capabilities:
- Business logic
- Specialized operations
- Internal services
- Domain-specific tools

### Tool Sharing

Share tools across agents:
- Reusable capabilities
- Consistent interfaces
- Centralized management
- Version control

## Comparison to Direct Tools

### MCP Tools

- Standardized protocol
- Server-managed
- Automatic discovery
- Isolated execution

### Direct Tools

- Custom implementation
- Agent-coupled
- Manual configuration
- In-process execution

## Best Practices

- Use MCP for external tools
- Use direct tools for simple, agent-specific needs
- Prefer MCP for reusable tools
- Consider MCP for complex tools
