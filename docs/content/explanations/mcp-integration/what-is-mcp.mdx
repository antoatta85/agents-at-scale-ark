# What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and data sources.

## MCP Overview

MCP provides:
- **Standardized Interface**: Common protocol for tool integration
- **Tool Discovery**: Agents can discover available tools
- **Server Management**: External servers manage tools
- **Protocol-Based**: Language and framework agnostic

## Why MCP?

Before MCP, tool integration was:
- Ad-hoc and inconsistent
- Tightly coupled to specific agents
- Difficult to discover and reuse
- Hard to manage at scale

MCP solves these by:
- Standardizing tool interfaces
- Enabling tool discovery
- Decoupling tools from agents
- Supporting multiple protocols

## MCP Architecture

```
Agent → MCP Client → MCP Server → Tools
```

- **Agents**: Use tools via MCP
- **MCP Client**: Ark's MCP integration
- **MCP Server**: External tool provider
- **Tools**: Actual capabilities

## MCP Servers

MCP servers provide:
- Tool definitions
- Tool execution
- Resource access
- Prompt templates

## MCP in Ark

Ark integrates MCP through:
- **MCPServer Resources**: Connect to MCP servers
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatically discover tools
- **Protocol Support**: Standard MCP protocol
- **Service Integration**: ark-mcp service handles connections

## Benefits

- **Reusability**: Tools can be used by multiple agents
- **Discovery**: Agents find tools automatically
- **Standardization**: Consistent tool interface
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools
- **Isolation**: Tools run in separate services

## Common MCP Servers

- **Filesystem MCP**: File operations
- **Database MCP**: Database queries
- **API MCP**: REST API wrappers
- **Custom MCP**: Your own servers

## Getting Started

1. Deploy an MCP server
2. Create an MCPServer resource
3. Tools are automatically available
4. Agents can use tools via references
