# Agents vs Teams - When to Use Which?

Understanding when to use a single agent versus orchestrating multiple agents in a team is crucial for building effective agentic systems.

## Single Agent: When One Is Enough

Use a **single agent** when your task is:

### ✅ Well-Defined and Focused
- Clear scope and objectives
- Straightforward workflow
- Limited decision points

**Example**: A customer support agent that answers questions about your product. It has access to documentation and can handle most inquiries directly.

### ✅ Single Expertise Required
- One domain of knowledge
- Consistent reasoning approach
- No need for specialization

**Example**: A code review agent that analyzes pull requests for security issues. It applies consistent security rules to all code.

### ✅ Sequential Processing Works
- Tasks can be completed in order
- No parallel work needed
- Simple input → output flow

**Example**: A data analysis agent that receives a dataset, analyzes it, and generates a report.

## Teams: When Multiple Agents Excel

Use a **team of agents** when your task requires:

### ✅ Diverse Expertise
- Multiple specialized skills
- Different problem-solving approaches
- Complementary knowledge domains

**Example**: A research team with a researcher (gathers information), analyst (processes data), and writer (creates report).

### ✅ Complex Coordination
- Tasks need coordination between steps
- Work must be validated or reviewed
- Information must flow between specialists

**Example**: A software development team: architect (designs), developer (implements), tester (validates), reviewer (approves).

### ✅ Parallel Processing
- Multiple tasks can run simultaneously
- Independent workstreams
- Faster completion through parallelism

**Example**: A content generation team where different agents create different sections of a document simultaneously.

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- Requiring oversight and review
- Multiple perspectives needed
- Error checking and validation

**Example**: A legal document review team where one agent drafts and another reviews for compliance.

## Decision Framework

Ask these questions:

1. **Can one agent handle this?** → Use a single agent
2. **Does it need multiple perspectives?** → Consider a team
3. **Are there distinct, specialized steps?** → Team with specialized agents
4. **Must tasks run in parallel?** → Team for efficiency
5. **Is quality/correctness critical?** → Team with reviewer/validator agent

## Team Strategies in ARK

ARK provides several team coordination patterns:

### Sequential Strategy
Agents work one after another, passing outputs as inputs.

```
Input → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Output
```

**Use when**: Work must happen in a specific order, each step depends on the previous.

### Round-Robin Strategy
Agents take turns processing tasks.

```
Task 1 → Agent A
Task 2 → Agent B  
Task 3 → Agent A
Task 4 → Agent B
```

**Use when**: Load balancing, equal distribution, similar capabilities.

### Graph Strategy
Complex workflow with conditional routing and dependencies.

```
           → Agent B →
Input → Agent A        → Agent D → Output
           → Agent C →
```

**Use when**: Complex workflows, conditional logic, multiple paths.

### Selector Strategy
AI-powered agent selection based on task characteristics.

```
Input → [Selector Agent] → Chooses best agent → Output
```

**Use when**: Dynamic routing, optimal agent selection, context-aware.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Single Agent
**Task**: Answer customer questions about order status

```yaml
# Single agent is sufficient
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: order-support
spec:
  prompt: |
    You help customers check order status. Access the order database
    and provide clear, helpful responses.
```

### Example 2: Team Required
**Task**: Create a comprehensive market research report

```yaml
# Team with specialized agents
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: research-team
spec:
  strategy: sequential
  members:
    - name: researcher    # Gathers market data
    - name: analyst       # Analyzes trends
    - name: writer        # Creates report
```

## Performance Considerations

**Single Agent**:
- ⚡ Lower latency (no coordination overhead)
- 💰 Lower cost (one LLM call)
- 🎯 Faster for simple tasks

**Team**:
- ⚡ Higher latency (coordination overhead)
- 💰 Higher cost (multiple LLM calls)
- 🎯 Better quality for complex tasks
- ⚡ Can be faster with parallel strategies

## Migration Path

Start simple, then evolve:

1. **Start with single agent** for prototyping
2. **Identify bottlenecks** or quality issues
3. **Add specialization** where needed
4. **Form a team** when complexity increases

## Best Practices

1. **Begin simple**: Start with one agent, add complexity as needed
2. **Specialize agents**: Each agent should have a clear role
3. **Define interfaces**: Clearly specify how agents communicate
4. **Monitor coordination**: Track team performance and bottlenecks
5. **Optimize strategy**: Choose the right coordination pattern
