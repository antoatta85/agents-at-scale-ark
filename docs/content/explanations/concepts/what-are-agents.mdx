# What Are Agents?

An **agent** in ARK is an autonomous AI system that can reason, plan, and act to accomplish goals. Agents combine large language models (LLMs) with prompts, tools, and context to perform tasks.

## Core Concepts

### Autonomous Decision Making

Unlike Franz simple prompt templates, agents can:
- **Reason**: Analyze situations and determine what needs to be done
- **Plan**: Break down complex tasks into steps
- **Act**: Execute actions using tools and APIs
- **Adapt**: Adjust behavior based on feedback and results

### Agent Components

An agent in ARK consists of:

1. **Prompt**: Instructions that define the agent's role, behavior, and capabilities
2. **Model**: The LLM that powers the agent's reasoning (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
3. **Tools**: Functions the agent can call to interact with the world
4. **Memory**: Persistent storage for conversations and context
5. **Configuration**: Parameters like temperature, max tokens, and retry policies

### How Agents Work

```
User Query → Agent Receives Input → LLM Reasons → Agent Decides Action → Tool Execution → Response → Memory Update
```

1. **Receive Input**: Agent gets a query or task from a user or another agent
2. **Reason**: The LLM processes the input using the agent's prompt and context
3. **Decide**: Agent determines what action to take (respond, call tool, ask for clarification)
4. **Execute**: If needed, agent calls tools to gather information or perform actions
5. **Respond**: Agent provides a result based on reasoning and tool outputs
6. **Remember**: Important information is stored in memory for future interactions

## Agents vs Traditional Systems

| Traditional System | Agent |
|-------------------|-------|
| Fixed workflow | Adaptive reasoning |
| Predefined logic | Dynamic decision-making |
| Limited context | Rich, persistent memory |
| Single execution path | Multiple strategies |
| Manual error handling | Self-correcting |

## Why Use Agents?

Agents excel at tasks that require:
- **Complex Reasoning**: Situations where multiple steps and decisions are needed
- **Uncertainty Handling**: When inputs are ambiguous or incomplete
- **Tool Integration**: Combining AI reasoning with external APIs and services
- **Natural Interaction**: Conversational interfaces that feel natural
- **Learning from Context**: Improving responses based on conversation history

## Agent Lifecycle in ARK

In ARK, agents are Kubernetes resources that follow a standard lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Define agent with YAML or via dashboard
2. **Deployment**: ARK controller ensures agent is ready
3. **Execution**: Agent processes queries when invoked
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance, costs, and errors
5. **Updates**: Modify prompts or configuration without downtime
6. **Scaling**: Handle concurrent queries and load balancing

## Example: Simple Agent

Here's what a basic agent looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: math-assistant
spec:
  prompt: |
    You are a helpful math tutor. Explain mathematical concepts
    clearly and show step-by-step solutions. Always verify your work.
  modelRef:
    name: default
```

This agent:
- Has a clear role (math tutor)
- Uses the default model
- Can be queried with math questions
- Will reason through problems step-by-step
