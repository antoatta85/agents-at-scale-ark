# Tools and Capabilities

Tools enable agents to interact with the world beyond language, extending their capabilities significantly.

## What Are Tools?

Tools are functions agents can call to:
- Access external APIs
- Perform computations
- Interact with systems
- Execute actions

## Tool Types

### REST API Tools

Connect to HTTP-based services:
- Web APIs
- Microservices
- External platforms
- Cloud services

### MCP Tools

Model Context Protocol tools:
- Standardized tool discovery
- Protocol-based integration
- External tool providers
- Server-managed tools

### Custom Functions

Define custom capabilities:
- Business logic
- Data transformations
- Internal services
- Specialized operations

## Tool Schema

Tools define their interface:

```yaml
spec:
  schema:
    type: object
    properties:
      query:
        type: string
        description: "Search query"
```

## Tool Execution

When agents use tools:

1. **Agent Decides**: Agent determines tool is needed
2. **Tool Called**: Agent invokes tool with parameters
3. **Tool Executes**: Tool performs action
4. **Result Returned**: Tool returns result to agent
5. **Agent Continues**: Agent uses result in response

## Tool Discovery

Agents discover available tools through:
- Direct tool references
- MCP server connections
- Tool registries
- Dynamic discovery

## Best Practices

- **Keep Tools Focused**: Each tool should do one thing well
- **Validate Inputs**: Ensure tool parameters are correct
- **Handle Errors**: Tools should fail gracefully
- **Document Tools**: Clear descriptions help agents use them
- **Test Tools**: Verify tools work independently

## Tool Security

Consider security when using tools:
- Validate inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Control access
- Monitor usage
- Rate limit calls

## Tool Patterns

### Search Tools

Enable agents to search:
- Web search
- Database queries
- Document search
- Knowledge bases

### Action Tools

Enable agents to perform actions:
- Create resources
- Update systems
- Send notifications
- Trigger workflows

### Analysis Tools

Enable agents to analyze:
- Data processing
- Code analysis
- Content analysis
- Performance metrics
