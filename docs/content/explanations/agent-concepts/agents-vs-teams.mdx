# Agents vs Teams

Understanding when to use a single agent versus a team of agents is crucial for building effective agentic systems.

## Single Agents

Use a single agent when:

- **Simple Tasks**: The task can be completed by one agent
- **Specialized Work**: One agent has all required capabilities
- **Low Complexity**: No need for coordination or handoffs
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize token usage and compute

### Example Use Cases

- Answering questions
- Generating content
- Simple data processing
- Single-step tool execution

## Multi-Agent Teams

Use teams when:

- **Complex Workflows**: Tasks require multiple steps or stages
- **Specialized Roles**: Different agents have different expertise
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- **Quality Assurance**: One agent validates another's work

### Example Use Cases

- Research and analysis workflows
- Code review and testing
- Multi-stage content creation
- Complex problem solving

## Team Strategies

### Sequential

Agents execute one after another, passing results forward.

**Use when**: Workflows have clear stages or dependencies.

### Round-Robin

Agents take turns handling requests.

**Use when**: Load balancing or equal participation is needed.

### Graph-Based

Agents are organized in a graph with conditional routing.

**Use when**: Complex decision-making and routing is required.

### Selector

A selector agent chooses which agent to use.

**Use when**: Dynamic agent selection based on context.

## Decision Framework

Ask these questions:

1. **Can one agent do it?** → Use single agent
2. **Does it need multiple steps?** → Use team
3. **Do steps depend on each other?** → Sequential team
4. **Can steps run in parallel?** → Graph or round-robin
5. **Is dynamic selection needed?** → Selector strategy

## Cost Considerations

- **Single Agent**: Lower token usage, simpler execution
- **Teams**: Higher token usage, more complex but more capable

Balance capability needs with cost constraints.

## Best Practices

- Start with a single agent
- Add teams when complexity requires it
- Use specialized agents for specific tasks
- Monitor token usage and optimize
- Test both approaches for your use case
