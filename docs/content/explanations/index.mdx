# Explanations

Welcome to the Explanations section. Here you'll find conceptual content that helps you understand **why** and **when** to use different ARK features, rather than **how** to use them.

## Why Explanations Matter

Before building with ARK, understanding the underlying concepts and design decisions will help you:
- Make better architectural choices
- Choose the right patterns for your use case
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Leverage ARK's strengths effectively
