# Why Ark Exists

Ark was created to solve specific challenges in building and operating agentic AI systems at scale.

## The Problem

Building production-ready agentic systems involves many complex challenges:

- **Orchestration Complexity**: Coordinating multiple agents, tools, and services
- **State Management**: Persisting conversations and agent memory across sessions
- **Resource Management**: Managing compute resources, costs, and scaling
- **Observability**: Understanding what agents are doing and why
- **Reliability**: Handling failures, retries, and error recovery
- **Security**: Isolating agents, managing access, and protecting data

## What Ark Provides

Ark addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Kubernetes-Native Platform**: Leverages Kubernetes for orchestration, scaling, and resource management
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define agents, teams, and tools as code using CRDs
- **Built-in Evaluation**: Test and validate agent behavior systematically
- **Standardized Patterns**: Proven patterns for common agentic use cases
- **Production-Ready**: Designed for reliability, observability, and security from the start

## When to Use Ark

Ark is ideal when you need to:

- Deploy agents to production environments
- Coordinate multiple agents working together
- Manage agent lifecycles at scale
- Integrate with existing Kubernetes infrastructure
- Build reliable, observable agentic systems

## When Not to Use Ark

Consider alternatives if you:

- Only need simple, single-agent use cases
- Prefer serverless or managed platforms
- Don't have Kubernetes infrastructure
- Need rapid prototyping without production concerns

## Comparison to Alternatives

Ark differs from frameworks like LangGraph or Autogen by:

- **Kubernetes-Native**: Built for production Kubernetes deployments
- **Declarative**: Configuration-driven rather than code-driven
- **Evaluation-First**: Built-in evaluation and testing capabilities
- **Multi-Tenant**: Designed for shared infrastructure and isolation
