# Core Resource Model

Ark's architecture is built around a set of core resources that work together to create agentic systems.

## Resource Hierarchy

```
Models
  ↓
Agents (use Models, Tools)
  ↓
Teams (use Agents)
  ↓
Queries (target Agents or Teams)
```

## Core Resources

### Models

Define AI model configurations and connections.

- Specify model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Configure API endpoints and authentication
- Set model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

### Agents

Represent individual AI agents with specific capabilities.

- Reference models for AI capabilities
- Attach tools for external actions
- Configure prompts and behavior
- Define memory and context management

### Teams

Orchestrate multiple agents working together.

- Define team members (agents or other teams)
- Choose coordination strategies (sequential, round-robin, etc.)
- Configure communication patterns
- Set execution limits and timeouts

### Queries

Represent user interactions and agent executions.

- Target agents or teams
- Provide input and context
- Track execution status
- Store responses and results

### Tools

Define capabilities agents can use.

- REST API integrations
- MCP server connections
- Custom function definitions
- Parameter schemas and validation

### MCPServers

Connect to Model Context Protocol servers.

- External tool providers
- Standardized tool discovery
- Protocol-based integration

### Memory

Persistent storage for agent state.

- Conversation history
- Agent memory and context
- Long-term knowledge storage

### Evaluators

Services for testing and validation.

- Evaluation criteria definition
- Automated testing
- Performance scoring

## Resource Relationships

Resources reference each other using Kubernetes references:

```yaml
# Agent references a Model
spec:
  modelRef:
    name: default-model

# Team references Agents
spec:
  members:
    - name: agent-1
      agentRef:
        name: researcher-agent
```

## Resource Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Resources are created via kubectl or API
2. **Validation**: Ark controller validates configuration
3. **Reconciliation**: Controller ensures desired state
4. **Execution**: Resources are used during query execution
5. **Updates**: Changes trigger reconciliation
6. **Deletion**: Cleanup of associated resources

## Benefits of Resource Model

- **Declarative**: Define desired state, not implementation
- **Composable**: Build complex systems from simple resources
- **Observable**: All resources are Kubernetes objects with status
- **Testable**: Resources can be validated independently
- **Versionable**: Track changes through Git
