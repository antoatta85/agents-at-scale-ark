# Kubernetes-Native Design

Ark is built on Kubernetes to leverage its proven capabilities for managing distributed systems.

## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides essential capabilities that agentic systems need:

- **Orchestration**: Automatically schedule and manage agent workloads
- **Scaling**: Scale agents up and down based on demand
- **Resource Management**: Control CPU, memory, and other resources
- **Service Discovery**: Agents can find and communicate with each other
- **Configuration Management**: Declarative configuration with ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and automatic recovery
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Isolate different users and workloads

## Benefits of Kubernetes-Native Architecture

### Declarative Configuration

Define your entire agentic system as YAML manifests:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  # Agent configuration
```

### Automatic Lifecycle Management

Kubernetes handles:
- Starting and stopping agents
- Restarting failed agents
- Updating agent configurations
- Rolling out changes safely

### Resource Isolation

Each agent runs in its own pod with:
- Isolated compute resources
- Network policies for security
- Storage volumes for persistence
- Resource limits and requests

### Observability

Kubernetes provides:
- Log aggregation
- Metrics collection
- Event tracking
- Distributed tracing support

## CRD-Based Architecture

Ark uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes with agentic concepts:

- **Agents**: Represent individual AI agents
- **Teams**: Represent multi-agent orchestrations
- **Queries**: Represent user interactions
- **Tools**: Represent agent capabilities
- **Models**: Represent AI model configurations

This approach provides:
- Native Kubernetes integration
- Standard tooling support (kubectl, Helm, etc.)
- Declarative management
- GitOps compatibility

## Integration with Kubernetes Ecosystem

Ark works seamlessly with:
- **Helm**: Package and deploy Ark applications
- **Kustomize**: Manage environment-specific configurations
- **ArgoCD/Flux**: GitOps deployment workflows
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Istio/Linkerd**: Service mesh for advanced networking
