# NGINX Gateway Endpoint Refresh

## Problem

NGINX Gateway Fabric uses static IP addresses in upstream configurations instead of DNS-based service discovery. When a pod is restarted and receives a new IP address, the gateway needs to be notified of the endpoint change.

### Root Cause

NGINX Gateway Fabric **does** watch EndpointSlice changes automatically and should reload nginx configuration when endpoints change. However, there are scenarios where this fails:

1. **Gateway controller not running**: If the gateway controller is down or restarting when an endpoint changes, it misses the update event
2. **Missed reconciliation**: The controller only processes live Kubernetes events - it doesn't always reconcile full state on startup
3. **Expired service account tokens**: The controller's service account token can expire, preventing it from communicating with the NGINX agent to update configuration

### Symptoms

- HTTP 502 Bad Gateway errors when accessing services through the gateway
- Nginx logs show `connect() failed (113: Host is unreachable) while connecting to upstream`
- The upstream IP in nginx config (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/http.conf`) doesn't match the current pod IP
- Gateway fabric controller logs show `invalid authorization: [invalid bearer token, service account token has expired]`
- NGINX is running but only listening on unix socket for status monitoring, not on port 80

## Solutions

### Short-term: Manual Reload

When you encounter 502 errors after pod restarts, force the nginx gateway to refresh:

```bash
make localhost-gateway-reload
```

This command:
1. Restarts the nginx-gateway-fabric controller pod (fixes expired token issues)
2. Restarts the nginx proxy pod (forces endpoint refresh)
3. Waits for both to be ready
4. On startup, the gateway regenerates config with current endpoint IPs

### Long-term: Monitoring and Auto-healing

The proper solution is to ensure the gateway controller is always running and healthy:

1. **Use NGINX Plus** (if available): NGINX Plus supports dynamic upstream updates via API, eliminating the need for reloads when endpoints change

2. **Monitor gateway health**: Add monitoring to alert when the gateway controller is down:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ark-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx-gateway-fabric
   ```

3. **Endpoint monitoring**: The gateway should automatically pick up EndpointSlice changes. If it doesn't, check:
   ```bash
   # View gateway controller logs
   kubectl logs -n ark-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx-gateway-fabric --tail=100

   # Check for endpoint update events
   kubectl logs -n ark-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx-gateway-fabric | grep -i endpointslice
   ```

## How NGINX Gateway Fabric Should Work

According to the [NGINX Gateway Fabric architecture](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/overview/gateway-architecture/):

- The control plane watches Gateway API resources, Services, Endpoints, and Secrets
- When endpoints change, the controller detects the EndpointSlice update
- It regenerates nginx configuration with updated upstream IPs
- NGINX is reloaded gracefully to apply the changes

**Why it sometimes fails:**
- If the controller pod is restarting during an endpoint change, it may miss the event
- Controller-runtime doesn't always reconcile full state on startup for performance reasons
- No reconciliation loop ensures upstreams match current EndpointSlice state
- Service account tokens can expire, breaking the gRPC connection between controller and NGINX agent

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements to make the system more resilient:

1. **Add reconciliation loop**: Periodically verify nginx upstreams match EndpointSlice IPs
2. **Upgrade to NGINX Plus**: Use dynamic upstream API instead of config reloads
3. **Add health checks**: Monitor for 502 errors and auto-trigger gateway reload
4. **Use StatefulSets**: For services where stable network identity is critical
